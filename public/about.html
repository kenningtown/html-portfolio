<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Khafiz Khader. I am a junior student at Nazarbayev University. Currently, I am an unemployed, but I am an upcoming Web Developer, hopefully.</p>
<p>I study Computer Science, I'm not a "straight A" student, but, I want to become the greatest of all time remaining 2 years. During these 2 years, we covered different courses of CS. I cannot say that all of them were super-useful. I think that most useful courses were Data Structures, PL, and Algorithms.</p>
<p>I bought this course because I'm interested in building websites. In the future I want to become a CEO of one Social Network.</p>
